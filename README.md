# lnd_Postman

This repository contains the JSON exported collection (2.1) for the [LND REST API](https://github.com/lightninglabs/lightning-api). 

To get started:

1. Download this file and import it into your [Postman client](https://www.getpostman.com/) of choice.
2. Create an environment containing variables for `http`, `url`, and `port` (by default they should be `https`, `localhost`, and `8080` respectively).
3. Ensure `lnd` is running and functioning correctly.
